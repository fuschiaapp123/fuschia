# Workflow Properties Enhancement

## Changes Made

### 1. **Replaced Intrusive Edit Box with Gear Icon**
- **Before**: Large edit panel that expanded inline and obscured canvas elements
- **After**: Compact header with a gear (Settings) icon that opens a side drawer

### 2. **Optimized Panel Layout**
- **Before**: Separate workflow metadata panel (top-center) and larger status panel (top-right)
- **After**: Clean workflow info panel (top-center) and minimized status panel (top-right)
- **Benefits**: Better space utilization, focused information display, reduced visual clutter

### 3. **Improved User Experience**
- **Clean Workflow Info**: Main panel shows workflow name, category, and basic stats (steps/connections)
- **Minimized Status**: Compact status panel shows only essential status information
- **Side Drawer**: Clean, focused editing experience that doesn't interfere with canvas work
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Gear icon with hover effects and tooltip

### 4. **Implementation Details**

#### State Changes:
- Renamed `isEditingMetadata` → `isPropertiesDialogOpen`
- Updated handler functions: `handlePropertiesEdit`, `handlePropertiesSave`, `handlePropertiesCancel`

#### UI Changes:
- **Workflow Panel**: Clean 400-500px wide panel with workflow name, category, and stats
- **Status Panel**: Minimized 160px wide panel with essential status indicators
- **Layout**: Separate panels for focused information display
- **Icon**: Added `Settings` icon from lucide-react with hover states
- **Drawer**: Uses existing Drawer component for side-panel editing experience

#### Benefits:
- ✅ **Optimized Space Usage**: Minimized status panel frees up canvas space
- ✅ **Focused Information Display**: Each panel shows relevant info without clutter
- ✅ **Better Visual Balance**: Clean separation between workflow info and status
- ✅ **Quick Status Check**: Essential status visible at a glance in top-right
- ✅ **Better Focus**: Side drawer provides dedicated space for editing properties
- ✅ **Improved Accessibility**: Existing Drawer component with proper focus management
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: Matches modern design patterns with gear icon for settings

### 5. **Usage**
1. **View Workflow Info**: The main panel at top-center shows workflow name, category, step count, and connections
2. **Edit Properties**: Click the gear (⚙️) icon to open the properties editor in a side drawer
3. **Monitor Status**: The minimized top-right panel shows workflow state (Ready/Running) and database save status
4. **Continue Design Work**: Both panels are compact and don't obstruct the workflow canvas

The optimized interface provides focused workflow information and essential status updates while maximizing canvas space for design work.
