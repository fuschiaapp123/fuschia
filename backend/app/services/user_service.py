# LEGACY FILE REMOVED
# This Neo4j-based user service has been replaced by postgres_user_service.py
# All user authentication and management now uses PostgreSQL
# 
# If you see this file, it means the legacy code has been cleaned up.
# Use postgres_user_service.py instead.

# This file can be deleted - it's kept temporarily to avoid import errors
