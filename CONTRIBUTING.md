# Contributing to Fuschia

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Fuschia! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## üéØ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Read and understand our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Familiarize yourself with the [README](README.md) and project architecture
- Set up your development environment following the installation guide

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuschia-alfa.git`
3. Run the setup script: `./setup.sh`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Backend (Python)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Maximum line length: 88 characters
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes

```python
async def create_knowledge_node(
    node_data: KnowledgeNodeCreate, 
    user_id: str
) -> KnowledgeNode:
    \"\"\"
    Create a new knowledge node in the graph database.
    
    Args:
        node_data: The node creation data
        user_id: ID of the user creating the node
        
    Returns:
        The created knowledge node
        
    Raises:
        ValidationError: If node data is invalid
    \"\"\"
```

#### Frontend (TypeScript)
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React best practices and hooks conventions
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance

```typescript
interface Props {
  title: string;
  onSave: (data: FormData) => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

export const MyComponent: React.FC<Props> = ({ 
  title, 
  onSave, 
  isLoading = false 
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Commit Message Format
Use conventional commits:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat(knowledge): add graph visualization component
fix(auth): resolve JWT token expiration issue
docs(api): update authentication endpoints
```
